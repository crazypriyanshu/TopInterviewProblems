    * Given undirected graph with A nodes labelled from 1 to A containing M edges

    * For the given graph, the edges, which on deletion do not disconnect the graph are compressed into a node
    * and the edges which on deletion disconnect the graph form an edge between these nodes.
    * The resultant structure will be a tree of course!
    * We have to find and return the diameter of this resultant tree.
    * NOTE:
    *   Input graph is connected.
    *   No multiple edges and self loops are present.
    *   Diameter of a tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest path in the tree.
